        <h1>Description from map page</h1>
        <p1>Drehmal: PRIMORDIAL is a massive, one of a kind Minecraft survival/adventure map with a heavy emphasis on exploration. Featuring fantastical custom biomes, unique weapons with incredible abilities, thirteen custom villages, towns, and cities, over 400 loot-filled structures, new advancements, special traders, tons of dungeons, a fast travel system, and a nonlinear main quest.
        <br><b>Drehmal: PRIMORDIAL takes what makes Minecraft so great and brings it to the next level.</b><br>
        While most maps strive for realism or taking directly from our real world, Drehmal aims instead for fresh, unique, and sometimes whimsical terrain. Survival gameplay experience is the top priority in Drehmal, ensuring that your time with the map will always be fun. This isn’t just a survival map with some extra features, though…
        <br><b>Drehmal: PRIMORDIAL is a fresh experience that provides much more depth to basic Survival gameplay.</b><br>
        The world is filled with lore and small stories, each region and town having carefully thought out histories that are reflected to an extent in-game. This map is a part of an incredibly extensive worldbuilding project that myself and Keeko have been working on together for over four years now. You can read a heavily simplified timeline of the world's history here, if you're at all interested.<br>
        We just released our first major update: v2.1, the Timebreak update. If you’ve already played Drehmal, this update is a great time to start again. You can check out the full changelog in our public Discord, invite link in Important Info.</p1>
