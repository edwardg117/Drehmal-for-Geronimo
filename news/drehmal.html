        <h1>Description from map page</h1>
        <p1>On October 27th, 2017, we released Drehmal. At the beginning of 2019, we decided to remake it from the ground-up. Drehmal v2: PRIMΩRDIAL is the culmination of more than a year of hard work and learning. Featuring entirely new high-quality beautiful terrain, a fully functional fast-travel system, thirteen custom-built towns, 300+ loot-filled structures, 16 unique weapons, one large dungeon, custom advancements, a resource pack, and a lightweight 'Main Quest'*.
        <br><b>Drehmal v2 is a completely fresh, unique Minecraft experience unlike any other.</b><br>
        Where most large-scale custom terrain maps strive for realism, Drehmal's terrain is designed to be unique and whimsical, with gameplay experience being the first priority. The entire map is incredibly detailed, every area purposefully designed with survival playability in mind.
            Other large-scale survival maps will just create the terrain, maybe build a town or two, and call it done. Drehmal is different. Across the map you'll find secrets, hundreds of unique buildings, hidden weapons, and stories.
        <br><b>This is not just a survival map with custom terrain, this is a fully fleshed out gameplay experience built off survival Minecraft.</b><br>
        The world is filled with lore and small stories, each region and town having carefully thought out histories that are reflected to an extent in-game. This map is a part of an incredibly extensive worldbuilding project that myself and Keeko have been working on together for over four years now. You can read a heavily simplified timeline of the world's history here, if you're at all interested.</p1>
        <br><p2 style="color: aliceblue;">*This 'Main Quest' is not the focus of the map, but rather something that will progress naturally as you explore and play the map. It's rather short, and purely serves as a means to access the End. The 'Main Quest' is primarily progressed by unlocking fast travel towers.</p2>
